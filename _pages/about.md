I'am PhD researcher at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/) within the [Department of Electronics and Informatics](https://etrovub.be/). My research specializes in using Applied Mathematics and deep learning for point cloud registration, with a focus on enhancing surgical navigation through augmented reality.

Previously, I earned a Masterâ€™s in Machinery Intelligence, co-accredited with the [National Institute of Applied Sciences of Rouen](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/), from the [University of Rouen](https://www.univ-rouen.fr/), and a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Computer Science from [Mohammed V University in Rabat](http://www.um5.ac.ma/).


My interests extend broadly to Cryptography, Security, Trust, and Privacy.
